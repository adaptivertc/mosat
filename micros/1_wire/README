This the source code to make the communication with an ATMEL microcontroller via Dallas one-wire.
It compiles with the avr-gcc compiler on both systems, Windows and Linux.

Still needs work for test in in the real world, by now it's just source code.

To install all the programs needed to compile under linux, using yum you just need to run:

yum -y install "*avr*"

as root, and the source will compile by just running make.


To run under windows you need to install the WinAVR compiler, available at sourceforge.

After installing WinAVR the source compiles by just running make.
