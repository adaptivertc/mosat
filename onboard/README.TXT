This is the program to run onboard of each train and enforce the speed limits on each section of the tracks. 

This is in development for pilot testing at SITEUR (Light Rail System Guadalajara).

To run in simulation mode, type "./speed -s"

After you are running, there are options such as:

  1) 'a' to go into automatic mode, so the train departs each station automatically.
  2) 'm' to go back to manual mode, so you have to hit to depart each station.
  3) 'f' for fast mode = 10x real-time
  4) 's' for slow mode or real-time mode = 1x real-time.
  5) 'q' to quit.

You can resize the text window, and the diagram will resize automatically to fit.

This program likely be expanded to work with radios and do collision avoidance, tell the operator about crossing guards, operation like a poor mans CBTC.
